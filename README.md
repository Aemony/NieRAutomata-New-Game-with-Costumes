# NieRAutomata-New-Game-with-Costumes
Completely blank save files with only the additional costumes added to them. Bundled w/ and w/o DLC costumes.

## Usage
1. Download the appropriate SaveSlot_2.dat and move it to My Documents\My Games\NieR_Automata. Rename it if necessary (Slot 1 -> SaveSlot_0.dat, and so on).

   * **Heavy Armor** only includes 2B's Heavy Armor costume that is unlocked in route C. This is for players w/o the DLC.
   
     *Note regarding the Heavy Armor:* This armor will be lost after the Prologue section, along with the rest of your items and secondary weapon. It can, however, be recovered when you arrive to the City Ruins by looting the old body at the Abandoned Factory. 
     
   * **Heavy Armor + DLC Costumes** includes both 2B's Heavy Armor costume as well as the 3 additional costumes that were released in the DLC. This is for players w/ the DLC.
   
     *Note regarding the DLC costumes:* These items will be lost after the Prologue section, and won't be recovered along with the other items when you loot the old body at the Abandoned Factory. However if you've equipped the DLC costume during the prologue section then 2B will still have this on her even after the self-destruction.

2. Use the bundled NieRAutomata-SteamID64-Editor to update the SteamID64 stored in the files to your own. For more information about that tool, see https://github.com/Idearum/NieRAutomata-SteamID64-Editor

3. Launch the game and load the slot. The character name will be '''NieR:Automata.'''

## Considerations
Also, be aware that as usual this comes with no guarantee what the effect might be on the game. The key items have been "forcefully" added to the save file by manually editing the file. This should be the safest way of adding them, but since it's impossible to test it out fully I can't guarantee anything.

## How it works
Simple hex editing based on my finding in [this thread](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/nierMnM/discussions/2/135512305405612076/#c1700542332339366348), combined with using [this awesome list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HQc9XkppRgNEFQ5zLgQW6BTqyFrPf2P6DxKz8x2S2oU/edit) of items and their IDs in the game.
