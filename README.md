# NieRAutomata-New-Game-with-Costumes
Completely blank save files with only the additional costumes added to them. Bundled w/ and w/o DLC costumes.

## Usage
1. Download the appropriate SaveSlot_2.dat and move it to My Documents\My Games\NieR_Automata. Rename it if necessary (Slot 1 -> SaveSlot_0.dat, and so on).

2. Use the bundled NieRAutomata-SteamID64-Editor to update the SteamID64 stored in the files to your own. For more information about that tool, see https://github.com/Idearum/NieRAutomata-SteamID64-Editor

3. Launch the game and load the slot. The character name will be '''NieR:Automata.'''

## Considerations
Also, be aware that as usual this comes with no guarantee what the effect might be on the game. The key items have been "forcefully" added to the save file by manually editing the file. This should be the safest way of adding them, but since it's impossible to test it out fully I can't guarantee anything.
